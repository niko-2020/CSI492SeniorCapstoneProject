# CSI492SeniorCapstoneProject
RTC CSI492 Senior Capstone Project Create by Mengni Wu and Bryan Robles. Start at 4/9/2023. Estimate end at 6/8/2023.
Project Title:
Super Archival Library site
Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create a website where users can browse,
search and download various files, such as pdf books and other media.
Description:
Our project is a website that is meant to be used as a bookstore where you can
download books and movies. Physical versions of books are in their own catalog and
can be ordered and shipped to the customer’s location. Digital versions include a
download link after being purchased. There will also be a category for movies, with free
movies that anyone can download and a second catalog with paid movies.
We plan on making it a primarily desktop website.Our project is meant to offer
more than just books for users to download.
Objectives:
For our project to be completed, we will need to:
1. Update our old bookstore project as template to start our project
2. Add new categories of products
3. Add the ability to download digital versions of products
4. Prepare for hosting using a web service
Success Criteria or Expected Benefits:
These are the quality standards we are setting for our project. Our project should
provide this functionality for it to be considered successful.
1. A customer can login and logout, and register a new account
2. Purchasing a physical book in shopping cart allows you to ship it to a location
3. A customer can immediately download the virtual books
4. A customer can immediately download movies
5. Having a search bar can help customers to find the targets. ISBN, and genre
Here is where you may describe the “boundaries” or scope of your project, the risks you
have identified and how you will respond if a risk happens!
Our project is meant to be mainly used as a digital media store with the option to
purchase physical books. The ability to download movies and books is core to the
project, but other files might be considered. We don’t intend to provide streaming
options.
The risks of our project would be making the download functionality work, since we
haven’t tried that yet. Another issue would be connecting the database with our website
would be difficult. We might be able to use a cloud database for our website but we
would need to spend more time on developing that, which can cause time issues.
Funding/Assumptions:
Will you require a budget for your application? If so, what is the budget?
What hardware and software will be needed to complete your work? (Technical
Requirements)
Visual Studio, SQL Servers, Azure or AWS. Depending on the cost of Azure or AWS,
we might not need a budget.
Our budget is 30$ an hour :)
Major Deliverables:
We plan on providing a functional website that can be browsed on desktop. We might
use Microsoft Azure or AWS, depending on which fits our current budget.
